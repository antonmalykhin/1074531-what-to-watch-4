      This movie is perfect in all its categories: credits, sound track, production, casting, writing, photography, editing, acting, and direction.
  I was amazed with the freedom of the use of the camera. This movie will change the way movies are made. Slow-mo, stills, black and white, and color were all used to brilliant effect.
